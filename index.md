# You are doing it!

Welcome to howToProgram, my collection of writings on programming.

Think of this repo as an exploration of how I think about programming.

If you have input or disagree, open up an issue, I would love to hear from you.

## Why are you writing this?

I m trying to articulate a philosophy of programming, specifically readability is all that matters in finished code.
Readability and that it works, but it working is secondary. Why? Imagine trying to get hard to read code to work.

## How to Eat the Elephant

I am going to prepare a Table of Contents for this project, but since it is non linear in its approach, don't worry if you go down a different road.

Also, I have tagged topics as they are mentioned, but haven't worked to completeness. If you are interested a topic that is tagged but incomplete, post an issue and mention the tag.
We can start a conversation about it.
