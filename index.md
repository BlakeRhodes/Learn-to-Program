# You've Got This!

Welcome to howToProgram, my collection of writings on programming.

Think of this repository as a journey through my programming thought process.

If you have any suggestions or disagree, feel free to open an issue â€“ I'd love to hear from you.

## Why Am I Writing This?

I'm trying to articulate a philosophy of programming, with a specific focus on readability as the key aspect of finished code. Readability matters, perhaps even more than functionality. Why? Imagine the challenge of working with code that's hard to comprehend.

## How to Consume the Elephant

I will prepare a Table of Contents for this project. However, given its non-linear nature, don't be concerned if you find yourself exploring different paths.

I've tagged various topics as they appear, though they may not yet be fully developed. If you're interested in a topic that's tagged but incomplete, raise an issue and mention the tag. We can then initiate a dialogue about it.
