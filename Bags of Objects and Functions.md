# Bags of Objects and Functions

Of course, we are talking about libraries. Libraries may sound like [Objects](Objects.html) which are [bags of values and variables](bags%20of%20values%20and%20variables).

The difference is scope, libraries should extend the language to include new actions you can take with the language.
This is a pretty open definition, but it is important to think about scope when thinking about libraries. 

Of course we want to stick to [SOLID](SOLID.md) principals, but in the case of libraries errors in  [Separation of Concerns](Separation%20of%20Concerns.md) are amplified.

## How Libraries Are Used

Let's start with thinking about how our library will be used.

The user, who is our peer programmer, wants to do X and our library will help them by doing Y.

First solve for X, which means we need to know more about our user. Since they are our peer, we can start by writing libraries for ourselves.
Let's do that for another project I am starting, I want a simple to use agent that takes advantage of [Spring AI](Spring%20AI). I am going to write it in [Kotlin](Kotlin.html)
because that is the language we are using. 

This means that I know what X is, the user (me) wants to create agents to start using in applications.

Now solve for Y, which means we need to know my motivation of wanting to write a library. I dislike [Boilerplate](Boilerplate.md). 
I will not spend much time on why, but it does not fit in to my work flow well. So I need a library that reduces the boiler plate needed to create an agent.

## Our Library

The user, who is our peer programmer, wants to use agents and our library will help them by providing a simple way to create one.

Now that we have that we can start thinking about that as we talk about how to build a library.

## Library Best Practices

These are partially generated by an [LLM](LLM.html). I use llms in these types of tasks to make sure I don't forget anything.
If you want to learn to program, you should learn some [Prompt Engineering](Prompt%20Engineering) to help. Even and industry vet such as myself benefits greatly from our new AI friends.

Example: [Create Best Practice Checklist](./Create%20Best%20Practice%20Checklist.md) 

Now I am going to use the output to make a final checklist.

Creating libraries in various programming languages involves a set of universal best practices that ensure the libraries are efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly. Here's a generalized checklist for programmers looking to develop libraries in any language:

### Universal Library Development Checklist

1. **Follow Language-Specific Coding Conventions**: Adhere to the established [Coding Standards](Coding%20Standards.md) and conventions of the language you are using.

2. **Utilize Language Features Effectively**: Make the best use of unique features and capabilities of the programming language to enhance your library.

3. **Ensure Interoperability**: If applicable, ensure that your library can work seamlessly with code written in other languages or frameworks.

4. **Minimize Dependencies**: Try to reduce external dependencies to avoid version conflicts and bloat in the projects that use your library.

5. **Provide Comprehensive Documentation**: Include clear, concise, and thorough documentation, with examples, setup guides, and API references.

6. **Implement Robust Testing**: Develop a suite of tests, including [Unit Tests](Unit%20Tests.md) and [Integration Tests](Integration%20Tests.md), to ensure the reliability and stability of your library.

7. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**: Use [Semantic Versioning](Semantic%20Versioning.md) for releases and strive to maintain backward compatibility, especially for minor updates.

8. **Easy Distribution and Accessibility**: Familiarize yourself with and utilize popular package managers and repositories relevant to the language for distributing your library.

9. **Responsive Maintenance**: Actively maintain the library by addressing issues, accepting contributions, and updating it with enhancements and bug fixes.

10. **Performance Optimization**: Where necessary, optimize for performance to ensure that your library does not adversely affect the performance of projects using it.

11. **Consider Providing DSLs**: If appropriate and supported by the language, offer [Domain-Specific Languages](Domain-Specific%20Languages.md) to facilitate more expressive programming patterns.

12. **Modularity**: If the library covers a broad functionality, consider making it modular, allowing users to include only the parts they need.

13. **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Engage with the community for the programming language your library is written in, seek feedback, and use it to improve your library.

14. **Follow Platform-Specific Best Practices**: Be aware of and adhere to any platform or framework-specific best practices if your library is intended for use within a specific ecosystem (like [Spring Boot](Spring%20Boot.md) for [Java](Java.md)).

Lots of stuff, huh. 

This is why were are going to use this for the book. It can act as an editor to this philosophy driven programming entertainment, so we don't go completely off the rails. 

Unless that is our goal at the time.
