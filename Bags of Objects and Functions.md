# Bags of Objects and Functions

In this discussion, we delve into the concept of libraries, which may seem akin to [Objects](Objects.html) as [bags of values and variables](bags%20of%20values%20and%20variables.html). The key distinction lies in their scope: libraries are meant to expand the language, introducing new actions and capabilities. This open-ended definition underscores the importance of considering scope when developing libraries.

However, it's crucial to adhere to [SOLID](SOLID.md) principles, especially since errors in [Separation of Concerns](Separation%20of%20Concerns.md) become more pronounced in the context of libraries.

## How Libraries Are Used

Understanding the application of our library is the first step. Consider that our library helps a peer programmer (the user) accomplish task X by providing solution Y.

To solve for X, we need to understand the user's needs. Since we are essentially the user, we can start by creating libraries for our purposes. For instance, I aim to develop a user-friendly agent leveraging [Spring AI](Spring%20AI.md) and will write it in [Kotlin](Kotlin.html), the chosen language.

Knowing X helps: I want to create agents for use in applications.

Solving for Y means understanding my motivation for creating a library. My goal is to reduce [Boilerplate](Boilerplate.md) which doesn't align well with my workflow. Hence, the library needs to simplify agent creation.

## Our Library

Our library will enable peer programmers to easily create agents, streamlining the process significantly.

With this objective in mind, we can better approach library development.

## Library Best Practices

These guidelines are partially generated by an [LLM](LLM.html), which I use to ensure comprehensiveness. Learning some [Prompt Engineering](Prompt%20Engineering) is beneficial for programmers of all experience levels, as it aids in harnessing AI tools efficiently.

Example: [Create Best Practice Checklist](./Create%20Best%20Practice%20Checklist.md)

Now, let's use this output to formulate a final checklist.

### Universal Library Development Checklist

1. **Adhere to Language-Specific Coding Conventions**: Follow the established [Coding Standards](Coding%20Standards.md) of the language you're using.
2. **Effective Use of Language Features**: Capitalize on the unique features of your programming language.
3. **Ensure Interoperability**: Make your library compatible with other languages or frameworks, where applicable.
4. **Minimize Dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum to prevent conflicts and bloat.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide clear and detailed documentation, including examples, setup instructions, and API references.
6. **Robust Testing Framework**: Include [Unit Tests](Unit%20Tests.md) and [Integration Tests](Integration%20Tests.md) to ensure reliability and stability.
7. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**: Adopt [Semantic Versioning](Semantic%20Versioning.md) and maintain backward compatibility for minor updates.
8. **Ease of Distribution and Accessibility**: Utilize popular package managers and repositories for distributing your library.
9. **Responsive Maintenance**: Keep your library up-to-date with bug fixes, enhancements, and community contributions.
10. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure your library doesn't negatively impact the performance of projects using it.
11. **Consider DSLs**: Offer [Domain-Specific Languages](Domain-Specific%20Languages.md) if suitable for your language.
12. **Modularity**: Make your library modular, especially if it covers a wide range of functionality.
13. **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Interact with the community, gather feedback, and use it to refine your library.
14. **Platform-Specific Best Practices**: Follow best practices for specific platforms or frameworks, like [Spring Boot](Spring%20Boot.md) for [Java](Java.md), if relevant.


## Conclusion

Quite a list, right?

We'll use this as a guiding framework for the book. It will serve as an editorial tool for our philosophy-driven programming journey, ensuring we stay on track.

Of course, deviating from the path might be our goal at times.
