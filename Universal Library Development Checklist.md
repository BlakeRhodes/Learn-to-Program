# Universal Library Development Checklist

1. **Adhere to Language-Specific Coding Conventions**: Follow the established [Coding Standards](Coding%20Standards.md) of the language you're using.
2. **Effective Use of Language Features**: Capitalize on the unique features of your programming language.
3. **Ensure Interoperability**: Make your library compatible with other languages or frameworks, where applicable.
4. **Minimize Dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum to prevent conflicts and bloat.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide clear and detailed documentation, including examples, setup instructions, and API references.
6. **Robust Testing Framework**: Include [Unit Tests](Unit%20Tests.md) and [Integration Tests](Integration%20Tests.md) to ensure reliability and stability.
7. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**: Adopt [Semantic Versioning](Semantic%20Versioning.md) and maintain backward compatibility for minor updates.
8. **Ease of Distribution and Accessibility**: Utilize popular package managers and repositories for distributing your library.
9. **Responsive Maintenance**: Keep your library up-to-date with bug fixes, enhancements, and community contributions.
10. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure your library doesn't negatively impact the performance of projects using it.
11. **Consider DSLs**: Offer [Domain-Specific Languages](Domain-Specific%20Languages.md) if suitable for your language.
12. **Modularity**: Make your library modular, especially if it covers a wide range of functionality.
13. **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Interact with the community, gather feedback, and use it to refine your library.
14. **Platform-Specific Best Practices**: Follow best practices for specific platforms or frameworks, like [Spring Boot](Spring%20Boot.md) for [Java](Java.md), if relevant.
