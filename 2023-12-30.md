Started using [Obsidian](Obsidian.md).

[Ideas](Ideas.md)
- Should write an [Agent](./Agent.md.md) in [Kotlin](./Kotlin.md) with hopes of adding it to [Spring AI](Spring%20AI.md). 
- Need to think of library name for it.
- Caching layers for vector searches might benefit from [Prompt Compression](./Prompt%20Compression.md)

Not sure what I should write about next as far as programming goes. I think the book is interesting, but I am hitting a wall. I am going to chronicle my writing the agent. I will start by defining an [Agent](./Agent.md.md).

I also experimented with using an [LLM](./LLM.md) to rewrite a users [Vector Store](Vector%20Store.md) [Query](Query.md).

It was interesting, going to play with it further and try to find out if anyone else has done this.
