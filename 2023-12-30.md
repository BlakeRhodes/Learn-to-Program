Started using [[Obsidian]].

[[Ideas]]
- Should write an [[Agent]] in [[Kotlin]] with hopes of adding it to [[Spring AI]]. 
- Need to think of library name for it.
- Caching layers for vector searches might benefit from [[Prompt Compression]]

Not sure what I should write about next as far as programming goes. I think the book is interesting, but I am hitting a wall. I am going to chronicle my writing the agent. I will start by defining an [[Agent]].

I also experimented with using an [[LLM]] to rewrite a users [[Vector Store]] [[Query]].

It was interesting, going to play with it further and try to find out if anyone else has done this.
