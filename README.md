# YOU ARE DOING IT

Yeah, this is a read me, but think of it more as forward. 

I am writing a philosophy of programming.

Why?

Because I have one. If this philosophy already exists then let me know, and I will fork it.
I probably have a PR. Cause I know what I want.

I know code is expressive, I know code is Art.
I want code to be human readable.

I want to think about code from a NLP stand point. How can we make code human readable?
When we get there, then NLP will allow us to make readable code.

Until then, we are working with tons of training data that doesn't always make that happen.

I am seeking readability, in the Art of Coding. Why not the Adventure story in code?
Why not some satire?

Think of this a collection of short stories.
