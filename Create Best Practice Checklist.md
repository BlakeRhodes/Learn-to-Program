Search the web for best practices when building Kotlin libraries for spring boot, and summarize them

ChatGPT

Building Kotlin libraries for Spring Boot involves adhering to several best practices to ensure effective integration and performance. Here's a summarized list of the best practices based on various sources:

1. **Kotlin-Specific Dependencies**: Include Kotlin-specific dependencies in your project, such as `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` for the basic Kotlin standard library, `jackson-module-kotlin` for serializing and deserializing Kotlin classes, and `kotlin-reflect` for reflection features in Spring 5​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/)​.
    
2. **Maven Configuration**: Use the `kotlin-maven-plugin` and configure it in the `pom.xml` file to ensure that Maven recognizes Kotlin source files​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20we%20have%20to%20add,pom.xml)​.
    
3. **Utilizing Kotlin's Null-Safety Feature**: Add the compiler argument `-Xjsr305=strict` to leverage Kotlin's null-safety with the Java-based Spring Framework​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/)​.
    
4. **Code Formatting**: Include tools like `ktlint` in the Maven `validate` phase to ensure adherence to Kotlin formatting conventions​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20best%20practice%2C,build%20if%20there%27s%20malformatted%20code)​.
    
5. **JPA Considerations**: Use mutable classes instead of Kotlin's `data` classes for JPA entities since JPA is not designed to work with immutable classes​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/#:~:text=You%20might%20wonder%20why%20I,have%20to%20use%20mutable%20classes)​.
    
6. **Testing Practices**: Kotlin allows using method names with spaces enclosed in backticks, improving the readability of test names. This is particularly useful in unit and integration tests​[](https://rieckpil.de/create-spring-boot-applications-with-maven-and-kotlin/)​.
    
7. **Library Naming**: For third-party starters, use names ending with `spring-boot-starter` and beginning with the project or technology name​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/)​.
    
8. **Auto-Configuration**: Create an auto-configuration class and avoid annotating each bean with `@Component` or `@Service`. Instead, define them in the auto-configured module​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/)​.
    
9. **Spring Factories File**: To enable auto-configuration, create a `spring.factories` file in the `/src/main/resources/META-INF` directory​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/#:~:text=To%20enable%20auto,pl.piomin.logging.config.SpringLoggingAutoConfiguration)​.
    
10. **Process Annotations**: If creating custom annotations, ensure they are processed correctly in the context of Spring Boot​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/#:~:text=,widely%20used%20in%20Spring%20Cloud)​.
    
11. **Library Dependencies**: Your library should only reference necessary artifacts or starters. Minimal dependencies are recommended​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/#:~:text=,parent)​.
    
12. **Publishing the Library**: After development, publish your library, preferably to Maven Central, and follow the steps for publishing JAR files​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/)​.
    
13. **Promoting the Library**: Once published, promote your library through social media, articles, and by maintaining a well-documented GitHub repository​[](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/04/guide-to-building-spring-boot-library/)​.
    
14. **Configuration Properties Best Practices**: Work with configuration properties effectively, adhering to naming conventions and standards​[](https://dev.to/art_ptushkin/kotlin-spring-boot-configuration-properties-best-practices-13e6#:~:text=Working%20in%20Spring%20Boot%20stack,method%20based%20beans)​​[](https://dev.to/art_ptushkin/kotlin-spring-boot-configuration-properties-best-practices-13e6#:~:text=,class%20is%20not%20a%20configuration)​​[](https://dev.to/art_ptushkin/kotlin-spring-boot-configuration-properties-best-practices-13e6)​​[](https://dev.to/art_ptushkin/kotlin-spring-boot-configuration-properties-best-practices-13e6#:~:text=,default%20to%20prevent%20nullable%20field)​.
    

These practices will help in creating effective and efficient Kotlin libraries for Spring Boot, ensuring they are well-integrated, maintainable, and performant.

These are good. I am researching how to write libraries in kotlin in general. I have worked in software development but really don't know what the industry standards are for libraries. What is the general guidelines for building libraries in kotlin?

ChatGPT

Creating libraries in Kotlin, much like in any programming language, involves a set of best practices and industry standards to ensure the libraries are efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly. Here are some general guidelines for building libraries in Kotlin:

1. **Adhere to Kotlin Coding Conventions**: Kotlin has a set of official coding conventions that are widely accepted in the community. Following these conventions helps in maintaining consistency and readability of your code.
    
2. **Effective Use of Kotlin Features**: Kotlin offers various features like extension functions, higher-order functions, inline functions, and coroutines. Use these features effectively to make your library more powerful and flexible.
    
3. **Null Safety**: Kotlin's null safety feature is one of its key strengths. Design your library APIs in a way that makes nullability explicit and minimizes the risk of null pointer exceptions.
    
4. **Interoperability with Java**: Since Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, ensure that your library can be easily used in Java projects. This includes providing proper function signatures and considering how Kotlin's features map to Java.
    
5. **Minimize External Dependencies**: Limit the number of dependencies your library requires. Excessive dependencies can lead to conflicts and bloat in the projects that use your library.
    
6. **Provide Thorough Documentation**: Good documentation is crucial for any library. Include clear instructions, examples, and API documentation. Consider using tools like Dokka for documenting Kotlin code.
    
7. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for your library. Unit tests help ensure each part of your code works as expected, while integration tests will verify that all parts work together correctly.
    
8. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**: Use semantic versioning for your library releases. Strive to maintain backward compatibility, especially when releasing minor updates.
    
9. **Publishing and Distribution**: Familiarize yourself with processes for distributing your library, such as publishing to Maven Central or JitPack. Ensure that the library is easily accessible to potential users.
    
10. **Responsive to Issues and Contributions**: Be active in maintaining your library. This includes responding to issues, reviewing pull requests, and updating the library with bug fixes and new features.
    
11. **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for performance where necessary. Avoid unnecessary object creation, use lazy properties if appropriate, and be mindful of the impact of your library on the overall performance of applications that use it.
    
12. **Use of DSLs**: Kotlin allows the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs). If appropriate, provide a DSL for more expressive, readable, and concise code.
    
13. **Consider Modularity**: If your library covers a wide range of functionality, consider making it modular. This allows users to include only the parts of the library they need.
    
14. **Community Feedback**: Engage with the Kotlin community for feedback. This can be invaluable in improving your library and understanding how it's used in real-world scenarios.
    

Following these guidelines will help you create a Kotlin library that is robust, maintainable, and well-received by the developer community.
